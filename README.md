CDLI to Linked Open Data: tools and methods (i.e. Jupyter Notebooks) for making Linked Open Data triple statements in Wikidata and FactGrid from the cdli-gh (https://github.com/cdli-gh/data)

The conversions are done according to the rules stated in the [LOD Tablet Dictionary (FG Cuneiform)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/107ly4G5j3im6Hbifqw1HaB66zuqzf7ijN6q8A-WvH8s/edit?usp=share_link).

__Disclaimer:__ 

Please note that many alteration to the data are made on a case-by-case basis. Because of the sheer amount of data and the inconsistency in the initial data entry, we have to manually go through many of the data and then do data cleaning specifically targeted to the traits of the current data dump. Hence, the code may not be robust for future dumps. User should expect to carefully examine their data and make minor alteration to the code before using it. Nonetheless, the general idea should good.
